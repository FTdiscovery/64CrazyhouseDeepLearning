# 64CrazyhouseDeepLearning
A deep learning Crazyhouse chess program that uses a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based evaluation system and reinforcement to enhance its play style. Created as an individual project by a high school student.

Information on the inner workings and the code breakdown can be found on the blog post [here](https://ftlearning.wordpress.com/2018/08/13/64-a-crazyhouse-learning-project/). 

Side Note: Parts of the code are yet to be optimized since project is still in progress.


## What is this?

This is a framework of a neural network-based Crazyhouse Chess Engine inspired by the procedures specified by Google DeepMind and their multiple papers on AlphaGo and AlpahZero. This project was initiated in June 15, 2018, following the successful framework of a self-learning Tic Tac Toe engine that managed to solve the game in an hour. You may find the repository for that [here](https://github.com/FTdiscovery/GOMCTS); however, that project has yet to be annotated for the general public to use. 

Currently, this repository is designed for three processes: supervised learning (training a network model based on PGN master games), reinforcement learning (having the best network play itself to generate training games, from which this data can be used to train better networks), as well as self-learning (start with a randomly initialized or even a pre-trained Pytorch model if desired, from which training games and new networks will be created for however long the user desires.)

As of now, due to the lack of computational resources readily available for me, the focus is on creating a trained model based on top available games. From this documentation, I will explain the whole process of training a model and sending it back for further testing. 

Your name will be added on the list of contributors once you have uploaded a relevant file. :)

## Requirements

As this program was written, tested, and edited on the PyCharm CE IDE, I recommend that users also download this program and run the code on it. However, it is also possible to run it through terminal/other IDEs, provided that all the necessary libraries are downloaded. Python 3 (3.6) is strongly recommended.

In order to run all the files, it will be necessary to download the necessary packages:

python-chess
scipy
numpy (if that's somehow not on your computer)
torch (pytorch)
torchvision
pathlib

Once these are all running on your computer, then you will be able to continue to the next step!

## How to Run

Start off by downloading the repository through terminal...

    git clone https://github.com/FTdiscovery/64CrazyhouseDeepLearning.git
    
... or by downloading the ZIP file on the top right hand corner. Then we can continue to the next part.

### Supervised Learning

The first step is to create a database from actual PGN games. However, before we begin downloading information, it is important to first create two (empty) folders in the 64CrazyhouseDeepLearning repository. One will be named <i>lichessdatabase</i>, while the other will be named <i>Training Data</i>. You may change the names of them, of course - these are just the directories I have specified in the program - but bear in mind that it is necessary to change the code if you desire so.


## What if I have a GPU?

### Required Future Edits

1. GPU Optimization (Urgency: <b>High</b>)
2. Changes to playout mechanism. Right now, all playouts end only after a result (win or draw) is reached. However, in the future, the tree should be able to specify a search depth and use np.amax to determine the win probability in the final searched position (1-np.amax if depth is even). This has not been implemented yet, as all values outputted by the neural network are less than 1e-03 after the first ten moves or so. (Urgency: High)
3. Create a Leela-like online server training system for everyone to work with and to lend their GPUs on. (Urgency: medium)
4. Time Control â€“ If this engine is to compete in competitions, it must be able to determine when it can search further, and whether it has the time to do so.(Urgency: low)
Translate into C++? (Urgency: low)
