## What is this?

This is a framework of a neural network-based Crazyhouse Chess Engine following a similar reimplementation of . The project was initiated in June 15, 2018, following the successful framework of a self-learning Tic Tac Toe engine that managed to solve the game in an hour. Currently, the code is designed for supervised learning (training a network model based on PGN master games), reinforcement learning (having the best network play itself to generate training games, and training new networks from this data to overtake the best network), as well as a self-learning process (start with a randomly initialized or even a pre-trained Pytorch model if desired, from which training games and new networks will be
